    <div class="page_heading">Welcome to Michael Greenspan's Web Site</div>
    <p><font size="3" color="black" font face="verdana">My research interests are in the area of Computer Vision systems, especially problems of object recognition and pose determination as they apply to robotic systems. I've been particularly interested in recognizing, determining the pose of, and tracking 3-D objects in sparse range data. </p>

    <p><font size="3" color="black" font face="verdana">My research program is very collaborative: I work with a number of different companies and researchers at various universities, and of course my team of students. Some of the problems that we address are motivated by a specific industrial need, while others are more fundamental and are motivated primarily by our curiosity and intuition. In either case, we attempt to orient our results to specific applications, to solve real and important problems.</p>

    <p><font size="3" color="black" font face="verdana">I've been fortunate to be the recipient of a number of awards and honours, including: the 2003 Premier's Research Excellence Award, the 2003 Canadian Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Society's Young Investigator Award, and the Queen's ECE Club Favourite 2nd Year Professor Award in 2003 and 2004. I gave the Keynote Address at the 2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games, and along with my student and co-author Joseph Lam, was awarded the Best Paper Award and the Best Student Paper Award at the 5th Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision in May, 2008.</p>

    <p><font size="3" color="black" font face="verdana">Since July 2009, I have served as the Head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Queen's.</p>
