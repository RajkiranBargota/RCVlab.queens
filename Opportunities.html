 <p><i><b>AVAILABLE AVAILABLE </b></i></p>
      
<p>I currently have positions available for NSERC or OGS funded graduate students.<br> 

I do not currently have any positions available for students who are not funded by either NSERC or OGS. Please check back at this site periodically for announcements of available positions.</p>



<p><i><b>HOW TO APPLY</b></i></p>
      
<p>Send me an email with the following information:
<ul><li>your current academic status, i.e. current degree, university, and GPA.</li>
     <li>a copy of your most recent academic transcript (unofficial, electronic is OK).</li>
     <li>if you are applying from outside of the country, your TOEFL scores.</li>
     <li>a statement indicating whether or not you currently meet the requirements for admissions into ECE, as described here.</li>
     <li>a brief statement of your interests.</li></ul>

<p><i><b>UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES</b></i></p>

<p>I currently have some available positions for undergraduate student research assistants. As a research assistant, you will become involved in the research environment, working directly with me and my graduate students. Typically, these positions start either on a volunteer basis, or with NSERC USRA funding, and they can eventually lead to a graduate degree.</p>
